<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Welcome to our IoT-based memory game, a thrilling project developed with MicroPython and the Wemos D1 Mini development board. This interactive game leverages the power of the MQTT protocol, allowing seamless communication between the Wemos D1 Mini device and a web application for an immersive gaming experience. The game features three LEDs that illuminate in a random sequence, challenging players to exercise their memory skills. After the sequence concludes, players must replicate the pattern by pressing corresponding buttons linked to each LED. With three difficulty modes—easy, medium, and hard—our IoT memory game caters to players of all skill levels. Get ready to engage in a captivating fusion of technology and entertainment as you embark on a journey to test and enhance your memory prowess!
